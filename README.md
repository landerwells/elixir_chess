# Chess

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `chess` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:chess, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/chess>.

My goals for this project are to get a fully working web application up and 
running with multiplayer chess. I aim to achieve that through the Phoenix web
framework and using this as a starting back end.

I think there also might be something called GenServer, which could handle the
multiplayer if Phoenix only handles the front end and nothing else.

This will by my project for the year and I hope to get it done in 2025.
